# two-dilated-convolution
Dilated Convolutions in CNN(Convolutional Neural networks) are a type of convolution that “inflate” the kernel by inserting holes between the kernel elements. An additional parameter (dilation rate) indicates how much the kernel is widened.In this project I implemented 2 dilated convolution alogorithm and optimized it using various techniques.
